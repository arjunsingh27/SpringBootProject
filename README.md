# Employee Registration Web Application

Hi there! This web app is an example of how to build an employee registration system using **React** for the frontend, **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **MySQL** for the database. It demonstrates a seamless connection between the frontend and backend, perfect for anyone looking to learn about web application development.
 

 ## Purpose of the Web App

The purpose of this app is to build a simple yet efficient **Employee Registration System** that allows users to:

1. Register new employees by entering their details.
2. View, update, and delete employee records.
3. Manage and organize employee information in a user-friendly interface.
4. Integrate a Spring Boot backend with a MySQL database to store and retrieve employee data.
5. Provide a React-based frontend to display employee data and interact with the backend seamlessly.

This application aims to provide a hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications using modern technologies like React, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

### Installation

To run this application, you'll need Maven, npm, and Java pre-installed. These tools are required to build and run the project. Follow the steps below to get the app up and running:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arjunsingh27/SpringBootProject
    cd employee-registration
    ```

2. Build and run the backend (Spring Boot):

    ```sh
    mvn clean
    mvn package
    java -jar target/employee-registration-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

3. Install frontend dependencies and run the React app:

    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

Now, your app should be running, and you can access it on `http://localhost:3000`.

### PostScript

I hope this app serves as a helpful starting point for those who are looking to learn about full-stack development using React, Spring Boot, and MySQL. The integration of the frontend and backend is key to building efficient web applications.
